# Smoke test: hit every health endpoint exposed by the example stack
# and confirm a 200 response within a budget.
#
# This is the minimum useful nightly assertion: "the docker-compose stack
# came up and every service is reachable on its published port". It does
# NOT exercise OAuth strands / federation / any business logic — that's the
# job of the playwright e2e suite, which can run against the same stack.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — every probed endpoint returned 200 within budget
#   3 — at least one endpoint failed; failing services are listed on stderr
#
# Usage:
#   ./examples/smoke.sh                   # default 30 attempts per probe @ 1s
#   SMOKE_ATTEMPT_BUDGET=60 ./smoke.sh    # bump per-probe attempts
