//!
//! issued by coauth's `/oauth/token` endpoint. The bearer token is
//! not readable from JS (cookie has `HttpOnly` + `Secure` +
//! `SameSite=Strict`), so this module no longer exposes an
//! `access_token()` accessor — the API client sends the cookie
//! automatically via `credentials: "include"`. What we do still keep
//! in localStorage is a *non-secret* `session_active=1` marker so the
//! UI can decide whether to render the login page vs. the
//! authenticated layout. The marker carries no entropy and is safe to
//! read from JS.
//!
//! See `api::auth` for the write path (login / logout / refresh / OAuth
//! callback). This module is intentionally read-only and re-exports the
//! small number of cached read helpers from there so callers can
//! `use crate::utils::net::session::*` and get the full picture.
