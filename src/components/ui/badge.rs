//! `Badge` — migrated to yoface (`yoface::ui::badge::Badge`).
//!
//! This thin **adapter** is kept locally: sodmin's call sites use
//! `BadgeVariant::Default` (yoface renamed it `Primary`) and
//! `BadgeVariant::Success` (yoface has no equivalent semantic). The adapter
//! hands the 4 mappable variants over to yoface (rendered with css_module +
//! the Soft Orbit tokens); `Success`, having no such semantic in yoface, keeps
//! the local green-styled span implementation. The `class` named prop is
//! passed through as yoface attributes. The ~170 call sites need zero changes.
