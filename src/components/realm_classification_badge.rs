//! Visual badge that distinguishes "Principal Control" Realms
//! (those that back DID issuance and recovery) from
//! ordinary "Collaboration" Realms.
//!
//! Per AKP-0007 the classification is set at create time and is
//! immutable afterwards. Most Realm surfaces in sodmin (member panels,
//! Realm links, audit drilldown) should render this badge
//! so operators can tell at a glance whether an action will touch
//! identity-bearing infrastructure or just collaboration scope.
