//! HTTP client for the Realm authority-commit admin surface.

//! An administrator inspecting a Realm needs the same three facts a joining
//! client needs: which Station governs the Realm right now, how that authority
//! was reached from genesis, and where the Realm commit stream head sits. All
//! three arrive in one nonce-bound `RealmAuthorityBundle`
//! (`sync/authority-commit-log.md` sections 7 and 8); sodmin renders it and never
//! re-derives authority locally.
